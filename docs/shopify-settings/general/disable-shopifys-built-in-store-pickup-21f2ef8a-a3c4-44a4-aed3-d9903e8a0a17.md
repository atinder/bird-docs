**Disable Shopify's built-in store pickup to use Bird Pickup & Delivery exclusively.**

Shopify's native store pickup feature can conflict with Bird Pickup & Delivery. Disabling it ensures customers only see your configured pickup options.

## Disable Store Pickup Location

Follow these steps to turn off Shopify's built-in pickup functionality:

1. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Go to your Shopify admin dashboard
   - Click **Settings** in the left sidebar

2. **Access Shipping and Delivery**
   - Click **Shipping and delivery** from the Settings menu
   - Scroll down to find the **Pickup in store** section

3. **Configure Pickup Settings**
   - Click **"Your location offers in-store pickup"**
   - Select the specific location you want to modify

4. **Disable Pickup Option**
   - Toggle the switch to **Off** for store pickup
   - Click **Save** to apply changes

That's it! Your location now uses Bird Pickup & Delivery exclusively for pickup orders.

**Pro Tip:** When you set up Rates through our rates wizard by going to **Bird App > Rates**, we automatically disable Shopify's built-in pickup for you!
