**You'll learn how to disable Shopify's dynamic checkout button to ensure customers go through the date selection process before checkout.**

The dynamic checkout button bypasses your cart page entirely, completely skipping your Bird Pickup & Delivery date picker widget.

This means customers never see or interact with the date selection process, regardless of whether you've configured dates as required or optional in your app settings.

Disabling it ensures customers must go through your cart page where they can (and should) select pickup or delivery dates.
