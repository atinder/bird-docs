# How to Find and Generate Collaborator Request Code

**You'll learn when and how to locate your existing Collaborator Request Code or generate a new one in Shopify for secure external access.**

## What is a Collaborator Request Code?

## When is a Collaborator Request Code Required?

**Your store's security settings determine whether external collaborators need a code to request access.**

### Security Settings That Require a Code

- **"Only people with a collaborator request code can send a collaborator request"** - This setting requires the 4-digit code
- **Enhanced Security Mode** - Shopify may enforce code requirements for all stores
- **Manual Access Control** - You control who can request access to your store

### When a Code is Not Required

- **"Anyone can send a collaborator request"** - Partners can request access without a code
