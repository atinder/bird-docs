## How to Enable the Checkout Extension

### Step 1: Access the Checkout Editor

Go to your Shopify admin. In the address bar, modify the URL by adding `/admin/settings/checkout/editor?extensionPicker=true&page=checkout&context=apps` after your store's URL.

Your URL will look similar to `https://admin.shopify.com/store/mystore-name` (replace `mystore-name` with your actual store name). Remove anything that appears after `/store/mystore-name` in your current URL, then add the extension path above.

This will open the Checkout Editor, which works much like your theme customizer.

### Step 2: Find Bird Pickup & Delivery Extension

Look for our extension in the available extensions list. You'll see it listed as "Bird Pickup & Delivery" or similar.

### Step 3: Add Extension to Checkout

Click on the extension that says "Checkout Date Time Picker" and add it to your checkout form by clicking the "+" sign beside it.

You can then drag and drop it to your desired location.

### Step 4: Configure Extension Settings

Click on the "Manage App" option below the extension in the Checkout Editor to open its configuration panel.

In Bird settings you can, configure:

- Available delivery dates
- Delivery time slots
- Minimum order values
- Specific delivery methods to enable/disable

Refer to [How to Set Up the Bird Pickup & Delivery Widget](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/how-to-set-up-the-bird-pickup-delivery-widget-1tra0ra/) to learn how to configure schedule and rates.

### Step 5: Test the Integration

Place a test order to verify the extension works correctly.

Check that:

- Delivery date picker appears in checkout
- Selected dates transfer to orders
- Email notifications include delivery information (optional)

**Important:** This feature is exclusive to Shopify Plus stores due to Shopify's checkout extension requirements. The checkout extension works with all Shopify Plus supported payment methods and gateways.
