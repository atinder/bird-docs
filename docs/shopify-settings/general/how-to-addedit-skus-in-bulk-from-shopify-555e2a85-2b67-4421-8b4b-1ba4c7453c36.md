## Why Use Bulk Editing for SKUs?
- Update SKUs for multiple products in one session.
- Keep your inventory accurate and organized.
- Avoid repetitive manual edits.

## How to Add or Edit SKUs in Bulk

1. **Go to Products in your Shopify admin.**
2. **Select the top checkbox** to highlight all products you want to edit.
3. **Click Bulk Edit** at the top of the product list.

5. **Edit the SKUs** directly in the SKU column. Enter new SKUs for products that need them. Update existing SKUs as needed.

**Warning:** Double-check SKUs before saving. Changes are instant and may affect inventory or integrations. Export a backup if unsure.

6. **Click Save** at the top right when finished.
