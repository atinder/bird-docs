**Mark your products as physical products to enable shipping, delivery scheduling, and pickup options through Bird Pickup & Delivery.**

Physical products require delivery or pickup arrangements. Digital products and services don't need this setting. Marking products as physical enables delivery date selection, delivery rates, and pickup scheduling in your store.

## Method 1: Individual Product Edit

**Edit individual products to mark them as physical products.**

1. Navigate to **Products** in your Shopify admin
2. Click on the product you want to modify
3. Scroll down to the **Shipping** section
4. Enable **"This is a physical product"**
5. Click **Save**

**You're done!** The product now requires shipping or pickup arrangements.

## Method 2: Bulk Product Edit

**Update multiple products simultaneously to save time.**

1. Go to **Products** in your Shopify admin
2. Select all products you want to mark as physical
3. Click **Bulk edit**
4. Click **Columns** to customize the view
5. Scroll to the **Shipping** section
6. Enable **Physical Product** column
7. Mark all checkboxes under **Physical Product**
8. Click **Save**
