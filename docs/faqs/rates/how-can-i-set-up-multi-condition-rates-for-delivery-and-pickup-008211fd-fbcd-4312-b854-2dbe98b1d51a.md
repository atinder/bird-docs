You can combine these conditions:

* **Order Value:** Minimum and maximum price thresholds
* **Weight:** Minimum and maximum order weight (grams)  
* **Day of Week:** Specific weekdays or weekends
* **Time of Day:** Particular time periods
* **Delivery Timing:** Same-day, next-day, or rush orders
* **Urgency:** Based on delivery timings (e.g., same-day or next-day delivery)
* **Date Ranges:** Specific calendar periods
* **Product SKUs:** Target individual products
