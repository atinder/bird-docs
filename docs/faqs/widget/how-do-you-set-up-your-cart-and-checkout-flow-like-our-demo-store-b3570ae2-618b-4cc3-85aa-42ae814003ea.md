### Troubleshooting Rare Issues

If your checkout doesn't match our demo, review these rare cases. **Enabling Bird App rates prevents these issues automatically for most stores**.

#### Are you forced to choose store pickup twice (on the cart and at checkout)?

This happens when Shopify's native pickup rates are also active. Our Bird App Rates feature is designed to create a seamless, one-step process for your customers. To fix this, you must [disable Shopify's built-in store pickup](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/disable-shopifys-built-in-store-pickup-w4zg1p/). This ensures customers only select their pickup details once.

#### Are delivery options missing at checkout?

Our app manages delivery customizations for you. When you enable Bird App rates, the app is automatically added to your **Delivery Customizations** setting in Shopify. This ensures your advanced rate rules appear correctly.

#### Is the checkout text in the wrong language?

Bird App rates handle most languages automatically. For the few languages that require it, you can easily [fix the display with a manual locale setup](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/setup-checkout-locales-files-1cw3r7h/).

#### Still need help?

Our support team is ready to assist you. We will ensure Bird App works perfectly for your store.
