Your date picker will appear once these settings are active.

1. **Enable Bird App in your settings**
* Go to your Bird App dashboard
* Turn on the main app toggle
* [Full setup guide here](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/enable-the-app-in-your-theme-450cbp/)

2. **Activate the embed block in your theme**
* Access your theme editor
* Enable the Bird App embed block
* [Step-by-step instructions here](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/enable-the-app-in-your-theme-450cbp/)

3. **Only for custom themes: Add one line of code**
* If steps 1-2 are complete but you still don't see the picker
* Your theme needs this code snippet:

```html
<div id="birdchime-slots-box"></div>
```
