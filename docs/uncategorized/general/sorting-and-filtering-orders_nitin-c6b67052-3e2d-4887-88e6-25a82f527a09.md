When managing multiple orders, you can quickly sort and filter them by date, location, and delivery method to prioritize and organize your workflow. This is particularly useful for ensuring timely deliveries and efficient order processing. This guide covers two approaches for viewing and managing orders by date, delivery method, and location:

1. **Sorting and Filtering in the Bird App**
    
2. **Sorting and Filtering in Shopify**

Bird Pickup & Delivery app lets you quickly organize orders in your dashboard using multiple sort and filter options:

1. **Delivery Date:** Based on upcoming Delivery Dates.

**1:** In the Bird App, go to **Orders** and select **Sort by Delivery Date** as shown below.
