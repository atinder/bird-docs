### Setting Different Lead/Available Times for Specific Products

### Customizing Lead Times per Product

By default, the **Preparation Time** setting applies a single lead time to all products (e.g., 1 day). However, if certain products require different lead times, you can use the **Schedule Override** option in the **Product Override** feature.

### Example

If a smaller cake takes 1 day to prepare, but a larger cake requires 2 days, you can configure separate lead times for these products using the product override feature.

Additionally, you can refine availability by:

* **Blockout Dates**: Prevent orders on certain dates.
* **Available Dates**: Specify dates when a product can be ordered.

1. Go to Bird App Settings --> Product Override.

# Schedule Override: How to set different lead/available times for certain products?

Assume you set the lead time to 1 day in the Preparation time settings, which will automatically apply to all products **Preparation time**. But you have some products for which you want to configure different lead times, in that case, you can use the Schedule Override option in the Product override.

Ex. You make a smaller cake, which takes one day, but a large cake takes two days, so you can use the product override feature to set the lead time separately for both products.
