###### Bulk add tags to products in Shopify

We may need to group multiple products with the same tag for a variety of reasons:
* Restrict or enable shipping ex. particular products cannot be shipped
* Set specific preparation time
* Restrict availability of specific products
and more... 

In such scenarios we need to configure the same tag for all the products that need to be grouped. Find an illustrative example below: 

1. Select all products and uncheck those products which we don't want to group.
2. Click on **...**
3. Click on Add Tag

1. Write Tag name in search box
2. Select the Tag name
3. Click on Save
