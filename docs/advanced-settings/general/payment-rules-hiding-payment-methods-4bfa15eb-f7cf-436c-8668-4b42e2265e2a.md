**Control which payment methods customers see at checkout based on their delivery choice and store location.**

The **Payment Rules** feature in Bird Pickup & Delivery gives you precise control over payment method visibility. Hide irrelevant payment options to streamline checkout and reduce customer confusion.

## What Are Payment Rules?

Payment Rules let you **hide specific payment methods** when customers select certain delivery methods or shop at specific store locations. This ensures customers only see relevant payment options for their chosen fulfillment method.
