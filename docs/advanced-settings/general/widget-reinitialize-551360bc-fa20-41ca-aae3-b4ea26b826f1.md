**Fix widget loading issues in dynamic cart environments by configuring reinitialization settings.**

The Bird Pickup & Delivery widget sometimes needs reinitialization when your cart updates dynamically without page reloads. This commonly happens with cart drawers and AJAX-powered shopping carts.

## Configure Widget Reinitialization

### 1. Access Widget Placement Settings

Navigate to **Bird App Settings > Widget Placement** in your Shopify admin.

### 2. Set Reinitialize Delay

Increase the reinitialize delay to ensure the widget loads after your cart fully renders. This setting waits X seconds after your cart loads before initializing the widget, preventing timing conflicts.

- Higher values give your cart more time to load
- Start with 1 second and adjust as needed

### 3. Configure Element Watching

Use element watching only if reinitialize delay doesn't solve your issue.

- Select a parent element that contains your cart
- The widget monitors this element for changes
- When changes occur, the widget reinitializes automatically

### 4. Enter CSS Selector

Specify the CSS selector for your cart's parent element.

- Use your theme's cart container selector
- If nothing works, enter `document.body` as a fallback. Note: This may cause performance issues as it will watch for any change in the body.

## Advanced: AJAX Cart Widget Re-rendering

**For complex AJAX cart implementations only.**

When the standard reinitialization settings don't solve your issue, use the `data-watch-ajax` attribute for precise control over widget behavior during dynamic cart updates.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Add the Widget Container

Place this code in an AJAX-loaded page where the widget appears:

```html
<div id="birdchime-slots-box" data-watch-ajax="#element-to-watch"></div>
```

**Important:** Keep the `id="birdchime-slots-box"` exactly as shown.

#### 2. Choose Your Monitoring Strategy

**Watch by Element ID:**
```html
<div id="birdchime-slots-box" data-watch-ajax="#cart-container"></div>
```

**Watch by Element Class:**
```html
<div id="birdchime-slots-box" data-watch-ajax=".cart-wrapper"></div>
```

**Note:** Choose a parent element that contains your cart. The element should remain stable and not be completely replaced during updates, as it must persist across AJAX calls for the monitoring to work effectively.

### How AJAX Re-rendering Works

The `data-watch-ajax` attribute tells the widget to monitor a specific parent element for changes. When that element updates through AJAX or dynamic content loading, the widget automatically reinitializes itself to maintain functionality.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Start with reinitialize delay first.** This solves most timing issues without additional complexity.
- **Use element watching sparingly.** Only enable when delay settings prove insufficient.
- **Test with `document.body` if needed.** This monitors the entire page for changes as a last resort.
- **Implement AJAX re-rendering last.** Use this advanced method only when other solutions fail.
