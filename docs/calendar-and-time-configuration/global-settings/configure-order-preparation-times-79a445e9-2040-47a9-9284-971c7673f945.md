3. **Setting Preparation Time Options**

Choose from the following options:

* **Same Preparation Time for All Days:** Use this if your store’s lead time remains constant throughout the week.

* **Customize Preparation Time by Day:** Use this option if you want to define different preparation times for each day of the week.

4. **Setting Lead Time**

Lead time refers to the minimum time required before an order can be fulfilled. For instance:

* **Example 1: 4 Hours Lead Time**

If an order is placed at 10:00 AM on Monday, the earliest time slot customers can choose is at 2:00 PM on the same day.

* **Example 2: 1 Day Lead Time**

If an order is placed on Monday at 11:00 AM, customers will only see time slots available from Tuesday onwards.

* **Example 3: 2 Days Lead Time**

Orders placed on Monday will only allow customers to select slots from Wednesday or later.

5. **Understanding Cut-Off Time**

The cut-off time defines when your store stops accepting new orders on any particular day. Orders placed before the cut-off time can follow a shorter lead time, while orders placed after the cut-off will follow a longer lead time, often extending to the next day.

In the  example below:

* **Before Cut-off Time: 1 Day Lead Time**

Orders placed before 6:00 PM will have a lead time of 1 day, which means the customer can only select next day and beyond from the day of ordering.

* **After Cut-off Time: 2 Days Lead Time**

Orders placed after 6:00 PM will switch to a lead time of 2 days, preventing customer from placing an order for next day since you have stopped receiving new orders on that particular day.

This setting allows you to control when your store stops accepting new orders on a particular day

| 1. Ensure you configure preparation times for all 7 days if using the "Customize by Day" option.
| 2. Make sure the lead time set after the cut-off time is longer than the one set before it. This ensures the cut-off time functions correctly.
