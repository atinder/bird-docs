**Set order limits to control your daily delivery capacity and prevent overbooking.**

Order limits help you manage your delivery workload by restricting the number of orders customers can place for specific days or time slots. This prevents overbooking and ensures you can fulfill all orders on time.

## What are order limits?

Order limits control how many orders customers can place for:
- **Daily limits:** Maximum orders per day
- **Time slot limits:** Maximum orders per specific time slot

These limits apply to both delivery and pickup orders.

## How to configure order limits

### Step 1: Access availability settings

1. Go to **Bird App Settings > Pickup & Delivery**.
2. If you have multiple locations, select **Configure Locations** and choose your location.
3. Open the delivery or pickup method you want to edit.
4. Scroll down to the **Configure Availability** section.

### Step 2: Set daily order limits

1. Find the **Maximum Orders per Day** field
2. Enter your desired daily order limit
3. This limit applies to all time slots for that day

### Step 3: Set time slot order limits

1. Locate the **Maximum Orders per Time Slot** section
2. Enter limits for each time slot individually
3. Leave blank for unlimited orders in that slot

**That's it!** Your order limits are now active. Customers will see unavailable time slots when limits are reached. Make sure you factor in order processing and preparation time
