**Block specific dates from your delivery calendar to prevent customer selection of unavailable days.**

Use date blocking when your store closes on certain days. You can also pause delivery services temporarily. This feature prevents customers from selecting blocked dates for pickup, local delivery, or shipping.

## Important Notes

- **Blocked dates only prevent new bookings.** Existing orders on blocked dates will not be affected. Consider your current order volume before blocking dates to avoid scheduling conflicts.

- **Changes take effect immediately** for new customer selections. Allow 5-10 minutes for changes to fully propagate across your store.

**Use date blocking for these common business situations:**

### Holiday Closures
- Block major holidays when your store is closed
- Example: Christmas Day, New Year's Day, Thanksgiving

### Temporary Store Closures
- Block dates for renovations or maintenance
- Block dates when you're attending trade shows or events
- Block dates for staff training days

### Staff Vacation Periods
- Block dates when key staff are unavailable
- Block dates during peak vacation seasons
- Block dates for team building events

### Special Events
- Block dates for private events or catering orders
- Block dates when you're operating at reduced capacity
- Block dates for inventory counts or system maintenance
