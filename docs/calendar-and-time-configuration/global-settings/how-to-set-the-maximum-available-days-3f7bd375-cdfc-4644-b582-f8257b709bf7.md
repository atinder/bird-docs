**You'll limit how far ahead customers can book deliveries and pickups.**

Maximum Available Days restricts your booking window for each delivery method. Set the total days (including today) customers see when selecting delivery dates. This setting counts **all calendar days**, including weekends and holidays.

## Configure Maximum Available Days

Set booking limits for each delivery method independently.

1. Open **Bird App Settings**
2. **Choose Your Delivery Method**
   - Click **Pickup & Delivery** if you have same schedule across your store locations
   - Click **Configure Locations** for multi-location stores (only appears if you selected "different schedules for different locations")
   - Click **Shipping** for shipping method settings
3. Select the delivery method you want to configure
4. **Set Your Day Limit**
   - Scroll to the **Blockout Dates** section
   - Find **Maximum Available Days**
   - Enter your limit (5 = today + 4 more days, 7 = today + 6 more days, 14 = today + 13 more days)
   - **Note:** Blocked dates count toward this total
   - Click **Save**

5. **Verify Your Settings**
   - Click **Widget Preview**
   - Confirm only your specified days appear
   - Test different dates to ensure limits work correctly

You're done. Customers now see only your approved booking window.

## Customer Experience

Your booking limits create a focused shopping experience.

### Without Day Limits
- Calendar displays unlimited future dates
- Customers see months of options
- Creates booking overwhelm

### With Day Limits
- Calendar shows only your approved days
- Future dates beyond your limit disappear
- Creates focused decision-making

**Example: 7-day limit on Tuesday**
- Customer sees Tuesday through next Monday
- Next Tuesday and beyond are hidden
- Calendar updates automatically each day
