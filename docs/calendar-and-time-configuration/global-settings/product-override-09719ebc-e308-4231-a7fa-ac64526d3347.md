## What is Product Override?
Product Override lets you apply different preparation times and availability rules to specific products. Use it to manage products that need more or less time to prepare. You can also control when certain products can be ordered.

## Why Use Product Override?
- Offer flexible lead times for products with different preparation needs.
- Control product availability for special dates or limited-time offers.
- Prevent orders for specific products on certain dates.

## How to Set Up Product Override

Follow these steps to configure unique lead times and availability for your products:

1. **Open Product Override Settings**
   - Go to **Bird App Settings** > **Product Override**.

3. **Choose Applicability**
   - Choose whether the override applies to all orders (**Global**), a specific **Delivery Method** (**Pickup**, **Delivery**, or **Shipping**), or a specific **Location** (for stores with multiple locations and different schedules).

4. **Enter Product SKUs or Tags**
   - Add the **SKUs** or **Tags** for the products you want to override.

5. **Set Lead Time**
   - Choose **Same Lead Time for All Days (Mon to Sun)** or **Customize Lead Time by Day**.

   - Optionally, set the **maximum number of days** customers can order in advance.

**You have successfully set up product-specific lead times and availability. Your changes are now live in the widget.**

## Key Notes and Best Practices
- You can create multiple overrides for different **SKUs** or **tags**.
- If a cart contains products with different overrides, the widget shows only the common available dates.
- If a day is disabled in your main **Availability Settings**, it cannot be enabled through **Product Override**.
