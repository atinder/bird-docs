**Configure your delivery and pickup availability to control when customers can place orders with specific dates and times.**

## Access Availability Settings

To configure your availability settings, go to **Bird App Settings > Pickup & Delivery** and access the delivery method settings.

If you have selected **"I have different schedule for different store locations"**, navigate to **Bird App Settings > Configure Locations > Select a Location** and then access the delivery method settings for that specific location.

## Set Your Service Schedule

Choose between two availability options:

- **Customize Availability by Day**: Set different schedules for each day of the week
- **Same Availability for All days (Mon to Sun)**: Use identical schedule for every day

## Configure Date and Time Options

Select the scheduling option that best fits your business needs. Each option controls what customers must choose before checkout.

### Date-Only Scheduling

Choose **"Only Date"** to let customers select delivery/pickup dates without specific times.

### Date and Time Scheduling

Choose **"Date & time"** to offer specific time slots for each date.

### Date and Time Range Scheduling

Choose **"Date & time range"** to offer flexible time windows instead of fixed slots.

## Set Maximum Order Limits

Control your order capacity by setting daily or time slot limits. When limits are reached, those options automatically disable for customers.
