Click **Add condition** to combine multiple pricing factors.

## Condition Value Guidelines

- **Price:** Set minimum and maximum order values.
- **Weight:** Configure weight ranges in grams.
- **Day:** Specify start and end days of the week.
- **SKU:** Add product-specific rate configurations.
- **Urgency:** Define minimum and maximum rush delivery days.
- **Time:** Set delivery time slot ranges.
- **Date:** Choose calendar date ranges.
- **Multiple:** Combine any of the above conditions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Overlapping conditions:** Don't set conflicting date ranges or time slots.
- **Missing minimums:** Always set a minimum value for price/weight conditions.
- **Test your rates:** Check that rates apply correctly.

## Advanced Configuration Tips

- **Location-specific rates:** You can configure different rates for each location by adding rates individually. This approach differs from using uniform rates across all locations. Refer to [this article](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/configure-local-delivery-rates-based-on-postal-code-16da0ew/) for more information.
- **Rush delivery pricing:** Use the Rush Delivery condition type and set minimum days to 0 (same day) and maximum days to 1 (next day) with your premium rate.
- **Complex pricing rules:** Combine multiple conditions by clicking "Add condition." Mix price, weight, day, time, and other factors for sophisticated pricing strategies.
