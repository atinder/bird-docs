When setting up store pickup in Shopify and integrating BirdApp, it's important to **disable Shopify's store pickup** to avoid customer confusion.

If both options are enabled, customers will see **two pickup choices** at checkout:

* **BirdApp Store Pickup:** Displays the store address selected in the cart.
* **Shopify Store Pickup: **Asks the customer to select a location again or picks default location.

This can create uncertainty, as customers may not understand the difference between the two options.

|| During rates setup, BirdApp **automatically disables Shopify store pickup **to prevent issues. **Merchants must confirm this to proceed.**

**For Pickup-Only Stores:**

| If you only offer store pickup with no rates, Shopifyâ€™s pickup can remain enabled, as BirdApp will attach a pickup time in the cart.

However, if you offer **multiple fulfilment methods** especially with rates (e.g., shipping or local delivery), keeping both options enabled may confuse customers.
