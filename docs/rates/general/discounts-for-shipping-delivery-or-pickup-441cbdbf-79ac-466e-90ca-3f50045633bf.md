The **Bird App** allows you to automatically apply Shopify discount codes during checkout based on the selected delivery method— **Shipping**, **Local Delivery**, or **Pickup**. This helps streamline promotional offers and ensures customers see the right discount without having to manually enter a code.

## Steps to Configure Discounts

1. **Create a Discount in Shopify**
    
* Go to your **Shopify Admin → Discounts**
* Create a new discount code (e.g., `fiftyoff`, `testdiscountshipping`, etc.) with the conditions and value you want.

2. Once saved, copy the exact name of the code you've created.

3. In your Bird App dashboard, navigate to **Settings → Discounts**

4. Paste the discount code in the Shipping, Delivery or Pick Up discount code field(s) based on where the discount should apply.

6. Discount is Automatically Applied
    
* During checkout, when a customer selects **Shipping**, **Delivery**, or **Pickup** through the Bird widget, the associated discount code will be automatically applied to their order.

## Important Notes

|| The discount must be active and valid in Shopify for it to apply.
