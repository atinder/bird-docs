**Automatically apply Shopify discount codes when customers select specific delivery methods during checkout.**

The Bird Pickup & Delivery app automatically applies your Shopify discount codes based on the customer's chosen delivery method: **Shipping**, **Local Delivery**, or **Pickup**. This eliminates manual code entry and ensures customers always see the right promotional offers.

## What You'll Accomplish

- Create discount codes in Shopify Admin
- Configure automatic application in Bird App
- Test the discount flow during checkout

## Create Your Discount Code

1. Navigate to **Shopify Admin → Discounts**
2. Click **Create discount**
3. Set your discount conditions and value
4. Save the discount code

5. Copy the exact discount code name for the next step

## Configure Automatic Application

1. Open your **Bird App dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings → Discounts**
3. Paste your discount code into the appropriate field:
   - **Shipping discount code** for shipping orders
   - **Delivery discount code** for local delivery orders  
   - **Pickup discount code** for store pickup orders

That's it! Your discount will now apply automatically.

## Key Requirements

- Your Shopify discount must be **active and valid**
- Only **one discount** applies per delivery method

## FAQs

##### Can I use the same discount code for multiple delivery methods?
No, each delivery method requires a separate discount code configuration in the Bird App.

##### What happens if my Shopify discount expires?
The discount will not apply automatically. Ensure your discount remains active in Shopify Admin.

##### Can customers still manually enter discount codes?
Yes, customers can still manually enter discount codes that aren't configured for automatic application.

##### Do these discounts work with other Shopify apps?
The automatic application works independently of other apps, but conflicts may occur with apps that modify checkout behavior.
