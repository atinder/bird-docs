The **Bird App** allows you to automatically apply Shopify discount codes during checkout based on the selected delivery method—**Shipping**, **Local Delivery**, or **Pickup**. This helps streamline promotional offers and ensures customers see the right discount without having to manually enter a code.

## Steps to Configure Discounts

1. **Create a Discount in Shopify**
    
* Go to your **Shopify Admin → Discounts**
* Create a new discount code (e.g., `fiftyoff`, `testdiscountshipping`, etc.) with the conditions and value you want.

2. Once saved, copy the exact name of the code you've created.

3. In your Bird App dashboard, navigate to **Settings → Discounts**

4. Paste the discount code in the Shipping, Delivery or Pick Up discount code field(s) based on where the discount should apply.

6. Discount is Automatically Applied
    
* During checkout, when a customer selects **Shipping**, **Delivery**, or **Pickup** through the Bird widget, the associated discount code will be automatically applied to their order.

## Important Notes

* The discount must be **active and valid** in Shopify for it to apply.
* Only one discount can be applied per method.
* This feature helps eliminate manual entry errors and ensures a smoother checkout experience.
