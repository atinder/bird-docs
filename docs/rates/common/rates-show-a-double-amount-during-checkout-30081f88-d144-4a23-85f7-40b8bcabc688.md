# Why do shipping rates show double on the checkout page?

If you create multiple shipping profiles or have multiple locations within profiles, then some orders might contain products from different profiles or locations. When this happens, the separate shipping rates for each product are combined, and a single shipping rate is displayed to your customer at checkout.

1. Multiple profiles are created in shipping and delivery settings.

2. Rates configured in different profiles

4. Rates are combined from both of the profiles.
