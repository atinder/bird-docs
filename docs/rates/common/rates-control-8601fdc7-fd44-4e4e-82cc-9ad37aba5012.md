- **Cart total + day of week** combinations
- **Cart total + time of day** variations  
- **Cart total + weight** calculations
- **Cart total + specific products** pricing

**Bird app rates provide maximum flexibility for complex pricing scenarios.**

## When to Use Shopify Rate Control

**Use Shopify rates for simple, standard pricing based on:**

- Basic price tiers
- Weight-based calculations
- Product-specific rates

**Shopify rates work well for straightforward pricing structures.**

## Setup Requirements

**Complete the Rates Setup in your Bird app first.** Rates automatically default to Shopify control if setup remains incomplete.

2. **Select the Rates section**
3. **Follow the Rates setup wizard**
    - **Choose your delivery method** (pickup, delivery, or shipping)
    - **Configure your rate conditions** and pricing
5. **Save your settings**

**That's it! Your rates are now active.**

### Shopify Rate Configuration

1. **Go to Shopify admin → Settings → Shipping and delivery**
2. **Select your shipping zones**
3. **Add your rate conditions** and pricing
4. **Save your configuration**

**Your Shopify rates are now configured.**

## FAQs

##### Can I switch between Bird app and Shopify rate control?
Yes, you can switch between control methods. Complete the Rates Setup in Bird app to enable Bird app control, or leave it incomplete to use Shopify rates.

##### Which rate control method is better for my store?
Use Bird app rates for complex multi-condition pricing (day/time/urgency factors). Use Shopify rates for simple price/weight/product-based pricing.

##### Do I need to configure rates in both systems?
No, choose one control method. Bird app rates take precedence when Rates Setup is complete. Otherwise, Shopify rates apply automatically.

##### Can I use different control methods for different delivery types?
Currently, [you must use Bird Rates if you use pickup with other delivery methods](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/why-do-you-need-to-disable-shopify-store-pickup-when-using-birdapp-store-pickup-7a6noz/). For other delivery types, you can use either Bird app or Shopify rate setup.
