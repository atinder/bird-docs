**Set one delivery and pickup schedule for all locations to simplify operations and ensure consistency.**

Use a single configuration for operating hours, preparation times, and product availability. Manage less and move faster.

## When to Use a Unified Schedule

Choose this option if:
- All locations operate on identical hours and holidays
- You prefer one schedule for every location
- You manage a single-location store

## Step 1: Select Schedule Mode

1. Go to **Settings** in Bird App.
2. Select **I have same schedule for all store locations**.

## Step 2: Enable Delivery Methods

1. Enable **Local Delivery** and/or **Store Pickup** as needed.
2. These methods use the same schedule across all locations.

## Step 3: Configure Global Schedule Settings

Configure these settings once. They apply to all locations.

**1. [Configure Availability](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/configure-availability-settings-199dozz/)**
- Set operating hours and time slots for delivery, pickup, and shipping

**2. [Preparation Time & Cut-off Time](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/configure-order-preparation-times-1b43s8n/)**
- Set lead times and daily cut-off times for your orders

**3. [Blockout Dates](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/how-to-block-dates-from-calendar-tllghq/)**
- Mark holidays or unavailable dates on the calendar

**4. [Product Availability](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/block-shipping-local-delivery-pickup-using-product-availability-t1zg9b/)**
- Include or exclude specific products for each delivery method
