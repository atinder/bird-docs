Follow this document if all your locations share the same **Delivery** or **Pickup Schedule**. This ensures consistent operations across one or more locations while simplifying schedule management. For unique schedules per location, refer to [I have different schedules for different store locations](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/i-have-different-schedule-for-different-store-locations-1f6j2p0/) document.
