# I have same schedule for all store locations

Use this guide if all your locations share the same **Delivery** or **Pickup Schedule**. This ensures consistent operations across one or more locations while simplifying schedule management. For unique schedules per location, see [I have different schedules for different store locations](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/i-have-different-schedule-for-different-store-locations-1f6j2p0/).

## Step 1: Choose Your Schedule Mode

1. In the Bird App dashboard, go to **Settings**.
2. At the top of the Settings page, select **I have same schedule for all my store locations** by clicking the corresponding checkbox. (See screenshot above.)

*Once selected, the options for Pickup & Delivery, Shipping, and Product Overrides will appear on the main dashboard.*

## Step 2: Enable Local Delivery and/or Store Pickup

1. In the **General** section, click **Pickup & Delivery**.

## Step 4: Set Preparation Time, Cut-off Times, Blockout Dates, and Product Availability

- **Preparation Time & Cut-off Time:**  
  Set how much time you need to prepare orders and the cut-off time for your store. The cut-off time determines how late in the day customers can place orders for upcoming pickup or delivery dates. Orders placed after the cut-off time will be scheduled for a later date, based on your store's rules. You can set a single value for all days or customize it for each day of the week.  
  [Learn how to configure Preparation and Cut-off Times →](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/configure-order-preparation-times-1b43s8n/)

- **Blockout Dates:**  
  Mark specific dates as unavailable for pickup or delivery.  
  [Learn how to block dates →](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/how-to-block-dates-from-calendar-tllghq/)

- **Product Availability:**  
  Limit availability for certain products for pickup or delivery, based on your business needs. More details and options are available in the linked article.

*All these settings are available directly from your main Settings dashboard when using the unified schedule mode.*
