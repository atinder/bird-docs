# I have different schedule for different store locations

Set up unique delivery, pickup, and shipping schedules for each of your store locations. This allows you to tailor operating hours, preparation times, and product availability for every location in your business.



## When to Use This Option

Choose this option if:
- Your locations have different operating hours or holidays
- You want to offer different delivery/pickup methods at each location
- You need to set up location-specific preparation times, blockout dates, or product availability

For a unified schedule, see [I have same schedule for all store locations](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/i-have-same-schedule-for-all-store-locations-13ukhrg/).
