**Organize your orders efficiently using multiple sorting and filtering options in the Bird Pickup & Delivery dashboard.**

The Bird App provides powerful order management tools. Sort by delivery date or creation date. Apply multiple filters simultaneously.

**Default View:** Orders display in creation date order (newest first) by default.

## Sort Orders by Delivery Date

**Find orders for specific delivery dates or date ranges. Use this for fulfillment planning and delivery scheduling.**

1. Navigate to **Orders** in your Bird App dashboard
2. Select **Sort by Delivery Date** from the sorting options

3. Click the **Date Picker** to select your desired date range
4. Choose either:
   - **Single Date** for orders on one specific day
   - **Date Range** for orders across multiple days

## Sort Orders by Creation Date

**View orders in chronological order based on when they were placed. Use this to see recent orders or track order volume over time.**

1. Go to **Orders** in your Bird App
2. Click **Sort by** and select **Created At**

![Shows the sorting dropdown with "Created At" option selected to sort orders by creation date](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/-/c/a/8/2/ca826b447482b000/image-56_19mryh8.png)

3. Orders will display with the most recent orders at the top

## Apply Additional Filters

**Combine multiple filters to narrow down your order search. Use these filters simultaneously with sorting options for precise order management.**

Use these filters simultaneously with sorting options:

- **Delivery Method:** Filter by pickup, local delivery, or shipping
- **Location:** Filter by specific store locations
- **Order Status:** Filter by pending, confirmed, or completed orders
