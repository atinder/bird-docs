**You will create a validation message that prevents customers from checking out until their cart meets your minimum order requirements.**

Minimum order validation prevents unprofitable orders by requiring customers to meet your spend threshold before checkout. This feature reduces delivery costs, improves order economics, and ensures sustainable service levels across all fulfillment methods.

## Configure Minimum Order Validation

### Step 1: Access Delivery Settings

1. Navigate to **Bird App Settings**
2. Select **Pickup & Delivery / Configure Locations**
3. Choose your target location (if using multiple locations)

1. Locate the **Minimum Order Value** field
2. Enter your required minimum amount (in your store's base currency, decimals allowed)
3. Save your settings

**Configuration complete.** Your minimum order validation is now active for this delivery method.

## Important Configuration Notes

**Configure each delivery method independently** to optimize profitability across all fulfillment options:
- Local delivery
- Store pickup  
- Shipping

**Checkout is blocked** until customers meet your minimum order threshold, ensuring every transaction supports your business goals.

## Customer Experience

Customers receive clear guidance when their cart falls below your minimum threshold, encouraging them to add products rather than abandoning their purchase.
