**Prevent order scheduling conflicts by automatically expiring outdated date/time selections when customers take too long to complete checkout.**

For bakeries and physical stores, managing order timing is crucial. When customers spend too much time in checkout, their selected delivery or pickup times may become unavailable. This creates confusion and disrupts your preparation schedules.

The Abandoned Cart and Checkout Validation feature automatically expires outdated selections. Customers must re-select valid dates and times before completing their order. This prevents scheduling conflicts and ensures accurate order preparation.
