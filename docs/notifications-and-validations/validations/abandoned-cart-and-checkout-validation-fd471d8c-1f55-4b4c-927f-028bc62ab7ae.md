**
For bakeries and physical stores, managing order timing is important. If customers take too long to complete checkout, it can confuse and disrupt preparation schedules. This feature validates the selection, and the customer needs to re-select the date and time.

Customers benefit because they won’t accidentally place an order with outdated date/time sections, reducing mistakes and delays. This is especially helpful for fresh food orders and in-store pickups.

By enabling this feature in the Bird App, stores can avoid abandoned carts and keep order schedules accurate.
