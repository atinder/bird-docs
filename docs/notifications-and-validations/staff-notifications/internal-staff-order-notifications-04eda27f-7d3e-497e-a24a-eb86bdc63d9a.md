To ensure smooth order management, it's important for staff to receive email notifications with key order details, including the customer's selected date, time, and delivery method.

Hereâ€™s how to enable internal staff notifications:

* Bird App Notifications (Recommended): Use Bird App to send detailed staff notifications for new orders: [Enable Internal Staff Notifications via Bird App](/en-us/article/enable-internal-staff-notifications-via-birdapp-1kp1gtc)

* Shopify Staff Notifications: Alternatively, you can add date, time, and delivery method details to Shopify's default staff notifications: [Adding Date/Time and Delivery Method to Shopify Staff Notification Emails](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/adding-datetime-and-delivery-method-to-shopify-staff-notification-emails-ozlh06)
