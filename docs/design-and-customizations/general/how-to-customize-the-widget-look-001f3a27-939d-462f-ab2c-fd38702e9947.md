## Custom CSS Integration

**Add your own custom CSS for complete design control.**

**Important:** Test custom CSS on a staging environment first. Incorrect CSS can break your widget display or cause layout issues.

Enter custom CSS code to achieve advanced styling that goes beyond our built-in options.
