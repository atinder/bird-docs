**Change your Shopify cart type to unlock full Bird Pickup & Delivery app features and performance.**

The Bird Pickup & Delivery app works best on dedicated cart pages. This ensures optimal performance and access to all app features.

## Shopify Cart Types

The Shopify themes offer three cart types under **Online Store > Customize > Theme Settings > Cart**:

1. **Popup Notification**
   - Brief popup when items are added
   - Basic cart summary only

2. **Drawer**
   - Slide-out panel overlay
   - Good for browsing experience
   - Cart editing without page navigation

3. **Page** (Recommended)
   - Dedicated static cart page
   - Full product details and checkout options
   - **Best for Bird Pickup & Delivery app integration**

## Why Change to Page Cart Type?

Setting your cart type to **Page** unlocks:

- Enhanced app stability and performance
- Better user experience with detailed cart interactions
- Improved checkout flow

## Configure Cart Type in Theme Settings
