1. Complete the [Rates Setup](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/rates-control-jjcrrp/) in the Bird App if it has not already been done.

In case the Rates Setup is done and those options are still visible, [disable Shopify's in-built store pickup option](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/disable-shopifys-built-in-store-pickup-w4zg1p/) and [create a Pickup rate](https://help.birdchime.com/en-us/article/configure-pickup-rates-1n7gumb/) in the Bird App.

**After:**

| This will disable Shopifyâ€™s Pickup location selection on the checkout page, and the customer will see an address form with the pickup location autofilled.

To prevent confusion, you can modify the checkout page language to instruct customers not to change the pre-filled pickup address.
