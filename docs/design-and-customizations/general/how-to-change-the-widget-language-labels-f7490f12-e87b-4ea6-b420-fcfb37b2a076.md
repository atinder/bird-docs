**Customize your widget text and labels to match your brand voice and provide clear customer guidance.**

Configure all widget text in any language through Bird App settings. This includes calendar labels, delivery method names, and customer instructions.

## Access Text & Language Settings

1. Navigate to **Bird App Settings > Text & Languages**
2. Click the **edit button** next to your desired language

## What You Can Customize

The language settings allow you to modify:

- **Calendar and time labels** (date picker text, time selection fields)
- **Delivery method names** (local delivery, store pickup, shipping)
- **Customer instructions** (above/below widget, delivery-specific guidance)
- **Error messages** (validation errors, availability messages)
- **Order confirmation text** (thank you page labels)
- **Postal code checker messages** (availability confirmations)

Most fields support HTML formatting for rich content and styling.

## Change Calendar and Time Labels

Customize the date picker and time selection text to match your brand.
