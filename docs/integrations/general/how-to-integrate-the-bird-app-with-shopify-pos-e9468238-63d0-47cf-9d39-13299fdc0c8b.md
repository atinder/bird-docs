**You'll learn how to add date and time selection to orders created in Shopify POS, enabling customers to choose delivery or pickup times during in-store transactions.**

This integration allows your staff to add delivery dates, pickup times, and location preferences directly from the POS interface. Orders created in POS will automatically include these details in Shopify.
