### Assigning Different Google Calendars to Different Locations
To keep your order scheduling organized by location, you can link each location in your store to a separate Google Calendar.

#### Steps to Set Up:

1. **Create Multiple Calendars in Google Calendar**

* Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com), and under "My calendars", click the **“+” next to “Other calendars”**, then select **“Create new calendar.”**

* Give each calendar a name corresponding to a store location (e.g., “Location 1 Calendar”, “Location 2 Calendar”).

2. **Assign Calendars to Locations**

* Navigate to **Bird Pickup Delivery > Settings > Edit Locations/Configure locations/Shipping**.
* Select the desired location.
* Under **Internal notifications > Google calendar**, choose the calendar you want to associate with that location from the dropdown.
