The following are the action items to take when using our app with any subscription apps.

1. Configuring rates

One option is to configure all the rates via Shopify.
If you set the rate via the Bird app, you must use CCS (carrier-calculated shipping API).

|| Note: In case the rates are created via Weight, the weights in Kgs will be converted to grams automatically when CCS is enabled so you need to convert accordingly.

You need to check if CCS is supported in your current Shopify plan.

| Starter | Basic | Shopify | Advance | Plus |

| No | No | Can be enabled | Yes | Yes |

If it is supported, you can use the following option in our app to utilize it.

2. Updating tags or meta fields for recurring orders You can utilize the Shopify Flow app to update the recurring orders and attach useful tags or even update the metafields in the order.

Writing a Shopify flow totally depends on the subscription app that you are using and your specific business requirements.
